# TRUSTed Digital Architecture

Public marketing website for TRUSTed Digital Architecture, a founder-led digital architecture and software development firm. The site presents website architecture, custom software, AI-system planning, automation, integrations, learning platforms, and connected business systems without claiming unfinished products or integrations are live.

## Maturity

Production launch complete. The public information architecture and TRUSTed AI Business Architect are live at `https://digitalarchitecture.trusted-eco.org`, with a structured industry-aware assessment, blueprint, controlled preliminary estimator, and safe human-review handoff.

## Technology

- Next.js 15 App Router
- React 19
- TypeScript
- CSS visual system with no runtime UI dependency
- ESLint and Next.js Core Web Vitals rules
- Vitest content and route contracts
- OpenAI Responses API through the official server-side Node SDK
- Vercel deployment using standard Next.js output

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or another Next.js 15-compatible supported Node.js release
- npm
- Port `3023` available for local development

The website requires no database. Free-form AI questions require `OPENAI_API_KEY` in ignored `.env.local`; the guided assessment, blueprint, and estimator are deterministic. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and supply secrets securely; never commit or expose them to browser code.

## Install and run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3023`.

On Windows, double-click `START_APP.bat`. The launcher opens this repository, checks that dependencies exist, refuses to stop a conflicting process, starts the development server on port `3023`, verifies the responding TRUSTed site, and opens the local URL. `STOP_APP.bat` stops only a Next.js process verified to belong to this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
npm start
```

`npm start` serves the production build on port `3023`.

## Public routes

- `/`
- `/services` plus nine service detail pages
- `/solutions` plus eight solution detail pages
- `/products`
- `/industries`
- `/process`
- `/about`
- `/contact`
- `/website-audit`
- `/privacy`
- `/terms`

Contact and website-audit forms are explicitly non-functional previews. Authentication, databases, payments, uploads, backend services, and live external integrations are outside the current product boundary.

## TRUSTed AI Business Architect

The site-wide virtual architect begins with the visitor’s business type and progressively records business stage, offering, current systems, an industry-specific operations branch, pain points, goals, public website status, considered capabilities, budget, and timeline. Structured choices are local; free-form questions call `/api/assistant` once and receive a strict server-validated response grounded in relevant repository knowledge.

Non-contact assessment state and recent display messages use session storage for same-tab navigation continuity. Contact fields are not persisted in the browser. Free-form messages are sent to OpenAI with application storage disabled, so visitors are instructed not to submit sensitive or confidential information. No appointment, project acceptance, price, or email delivery is confirmed without a human response.

`/api/architect/plan` generates the blueprint and estimate from deterministic rules. The draft rates in `lib/business-architect-server.ts` are not approved for production. `/api/architect/lead` is disabled unless local test mode is explicitly enabled; it stores nothing and sends no email.

Production uses a sensitive Production-only `OPENAI_API_KEY` stored in Vercel. The current OpenAI project reports insufficient quota, so free-form questions return a clear temporary-unavailability response while deterministic assessment choices continue to work. The local `.env.local` file is never deployed by source control.

Secure lead storage, confirmed notification delivery, calendar booking, approved estimator catalog values, founder photography, and qualified privacy/legal review remain separate founder decisions. `/api/architect/lead` therefore remains disabled in production, and no appointment is represented as confirmed.

## Repository structure

- `app/` — App Router layout, homepage, catch-all public route, and styles
- `components/` — shared site shell, editorial renderer, and virtual business architect
- `knowledge/` — controlled repository-local company and industry knowledge
- `lib/business-architect-*.ts` — typed assessment, recommendations, blueprint, estimator, lead validation, and usage controls
- `lib/site-content.ts` — centralized typed navigation and page content
- `tests/` — route and content regression tests
- `docs/` — founder specification, execution plan, audit, architecture, assessment, estimator, lead, export, privacy, portrait, and Project Meter notes
- `AGENTS.md` — permanent autonomous operating contract
- `MISSION.md` — one active product-quality mission
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` — current verified state
- `BACKLOG.md` — ordered roadmap
- `DECISIONS.md` — founder-approved decisions

## Operating workflow

Future sessions begin by reading `AGENTS.md`, `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `MISSION.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, `README.md`, and the relevant specification. `docs/EXECUTION_PLAN.md` tracks substantial work within the active mission. Saying “Continue working” resumes the next incomplete milestone without requiring the founder to select routine implementation tasks.

## Deployment

Vercel project `trusted-digital-architecture` uses the repository root, Next.js framework preset, `npm install`, `npm run build`, and the default `.next` output directory. Production deploys automatically from GitHub `main`.

- GitHub: `https://github.com/CalebMillsSquad/trusted-digital-architecture`
- Production: `https://digitalarchitecture.trusted-eco.org`
- Vercel fallback URL: `https://trusted-digital-architecture.vercel.app`
- Production secret: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, stored only as a sensitive Vercel Production variable
- DNS: CNAME `digitalarchitecture` to `56546e7b60344d4f.vercel-dns-017.com`, managed at Squarespace with the root domain and all unrelated records preserved

See `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` for the verified production configuration, validation checklist, and remaining operational limitations.
