# Project Status

## Current build phase

Full public-site architecture implementation and founder review.

## Current application status

TRUSTed Digital Architecture is implemented as a responsive Next.js public website with a premium editorial design system, centralized typed content, shared navigation/footer, and 31 statically generated pages.

## What works

- Homepage positions TRUSTed as a digital architecture and software firm.
- Nine service pages and eight solution pages are implemented.
- Products, industries, process, about, contact, website-audit, privacy, and terms routes are implemented.
- Unfinished products and intake prototypes carry accurate status and limitation notices.
- Dedicated local port `3023` and guarded Windows start/stop launchers are configured.
- Vercel uses standard Next.js `.next` output.

## What remains incomplete

- Contact and website-audit interfaces are non-functional previews by design.
- External integrations, AI providers, authentication, databases, payments, and uploads are not included.
- Qualified legal review remains recommended before activating data collection or relying on legal pages.
- Founder visual and copy review is pending across the complete route set.
- Production dependency audit reports two moderate PostCSS advisories inherited through Next.js; the suggested automated fix would incorrectly downgrade Next.js and was not applied.

## Current blockers

The active Codex workspace keeps the legacy local folder handle open, so Windows will not rename `TRUSTed Website Architect` to `TRUSTed Digital Architecture` during this task. GitHub, Vercel, package metadata, public branding, and URLs are already aligned. The local folder rename can be completed after closing this workspace.

## Last completed mission

Implemented the founder-approved full TRUSTed Digital Architecture public website and project-local preview workflow.

## Current active mission

Complete the local folder rename after the active workspace releases its Windows file handle.

## Next Ready mission

Perform a route-by-route accessibility and responsive visual QA pass after founder content approval.
