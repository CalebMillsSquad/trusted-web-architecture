# Project Status

## Post-launch readiness audit (2026-07-21)

Added canonical metadata, Open Graph identity, Organization/WebSite JSON-LD, generated robots and sitemap routes, and conservative security headers. The assistant remains safe but is limited by the OpenAI project `insufficient_quota` response. Lead intake remains disabled without approved durable storage and confirmed notification delivery; its unavailable response now includes a request identifier and explicit storage/email statuses. No analytics or error-monitoring provider is enabled, and appointments remain requests until a calendar connection exists. See `FOUNDER_REVIEW.md`.

The lead boundary now also rejects a hidden honeypot and records a consent version/timestamp in validated request state without persisting contact data.

## Current Phase

Production launch complete — founder review and production limitation decisions

## Current Application Status

The 28-route TRUSTed Digital Architecture public website is live on the existing Vercel project at `https://digitalarchitecture.trusted-eco.org`. The custom domain is valid over HTTPS, the verified `main` branch is connected to production, and the production-only `OPENAI_API_KEY` is stored as a sensitive Vercel environment variable without entering Git or browser-delivered assets.

## What Works

- Premium responsive public website, complete navigation, route metadata, and honest product and integration claims
- Global TRUSTed AI Business Architect with deterministic guided assessment, industry branching, blueprint, preliminary estimate, and session continuity
- One strict-schema OpenAI Responses API call per free-form interaction, with server-only credentials and safe quota, timeout, rate-limit, and provider error handling
- Explicit disclosure that AI may be unavailable or incorrect and that appointments, pricing, project acceptance, and email delivery are not confirmed without human review
- Production-safe lead route that remains disabled because authoritative storage and provider-confirmed delivery are not implemented
- GitHub `CalebMillsSquad/trusted-digital-architecture` on `main`, existing Vercel project `trusted-digital-architecture`, and verified custom subdomain DNS

## Remaining Limitations

- The OpenAI project currently returns `insufficient_quota`; visitors receive a clear temporary-unavailability response and can continue the deterministic guided assessment.
- Estimator catalog values remain preliminary, explicitly nonbinding, and require founder approval before they should guide a real proposal.
- No approved secure lead database or confirmed email provider exists; production submission remains disabled and the direct email option is shown.
- No calendar is connected; the assistant never represents an appointment as scheduled or confirmed.
- The architect portrait remains a neutral placeholder pending founder-approved photography.
- Privacy, terms, estimator language, and retention design still require founder and qualified legal/privacy review.

## Verification Status

- Lint: pass
- Strict typecheck: pass
- Tests: pass — 4 files, 67 tests
- Production build: pass — 35 generated pages and three dynamic API routes; `.next/routes-manifest.json` present
- Secret scans: pass — tracked source, repository history, local client bundle, and deployed client assets contain no OpenAI key pattern; `.env.local` remains ignored and untracked
- Vercel: pass — production deployment Ready with the correct GitHub repository, `main` branch, Next.js preset, repository root, default output directory, and production-only sensitive key
- DNS: pass — CNAME `digitalarchitecture` points to `56546e7b60344d4f.vercel-dns-017.com` with TTL 4 hours; Vercel reports Valid Configuration
- HTTPS and routes: pass — 28/28 public routes return 200 at the custom domain
- Browser: pass — desktop and 390×844 mobile reflow, interactive architecture controls, AI assistant interface, no horizontal overflow, and zero console warnings or errors
- API boundaries: pass — malformed assistant, plan, and lead requests return 400; live assistant quota returns the intended safe 503 response

## Local Development

- Command: `npm run dev`
- URL: `http://localhost:3023`
- Local key: present in ignored `.env.local` without being displayed

## Last Completed Mission

Founder-approved production launch at `https://digitalarchitecture.trusted-eco.org`.

## Current Active Mission

Founder review of the live experience and decisions on quota, estimator catalog, portrait, privacy/legal language, secure lead storage, notifications, and calendar scope.

## Next Ready Mission

Implement the founder-approved production limitation package after the required provider, privacy, cost, and product decisions are made.
