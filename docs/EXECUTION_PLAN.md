# Execution Plan

Last updated: 2026-07-21

## Active Mission

Founder-Approved Production Domain and Vercel Launch

## Milestones

- [x] Read repository instructions, current-truth documents, product specification, implementation, and deployment configuration.
- [x] Confirm clean worktree, `main`, GitHub origin, repository identity, Vercel project identity, production branch, framework, build commands, root, and output directory.
- [x] Verify the local project key exists without displaying it and that `.env.local` is ignored and untracked.
- [x] Run lint, strict typecheck, all tests, tracked/history secret scans, production build, manifest checks, and client-bundle secret scan.
- [x] Push the verified local commits to GitHub `main`.
- [x] Store `OPENAI_API_KEY` as a sensitive Production-only Vercel environment variable and redeploy with current project settings.
- [x] Confirm no conflicting `digitalarchitecture` record, then save only the exact Vercel CNAME in Squarespace.
- [x] Verify public DNS resolution, Vercel Valid Configuration, HTTPS, 28 routes, API boundaries, desktop/mobile reflow, assistant interface, interactive controls, console health, and deployed secret safety.
- [x] Update current-truth, backlog, decision, setup, and deployment documentation and push the closeout commit.

## Verification Evidence

- Lint and strict typecheck passed.
- 66 tests passed across four files.
- Production build passed with 33 generated pages and three dynamic API routes; `.next/routes-manifest.json` and `.next/BUILD_ID` exist.
- Tracked source, Git history, local client output, and deployed client assets contain no OpenAI key pattern.
- Vercel deployment is Ready and uses the correct repository, `main`, Next.js preset, repository root, `npm install`, `npm run build`, and default output directory.
- CNAME `digitalarchitecture` resolves publicly to `56546e7b60344d4f.vercel-dns-017.com` with TTL 14400 seconds; Vercel reports Valid Configuration.
- `https://digitalarchitecture.trusted-eco.org` returns 200 over HTTPS and all 28 public routes pass.
- Malformed assistant, plan, and lead requests return 400. A live assistant request reaches the configured provider and returns the intended safe 503 quota message.
- Desktop and 390×844 mobile browser checks show one H1, no horizontal overflow, working architecture controls, a responsive assistant panel, and zero console warnings or errors.

## Remaining Production Limitations

OpenAI quota, estimator catalog approval, founder portrait, privacy/legal review, authoritative lead storage, provider-confirmed notifications, retention/recovery, and calendar booking remain founder-level follow-up decisions. Lead submission is disabled and appointments are never confirmed until those systems are approved and implemented.
